The Movement on the World tour map guides for guildwars 2 on Taco ! 

Simply put the "MoW.taco" into the POIs folder of the Taco App. 

In the Tactical Display Settings and submenu Toggle Visibility Behavior, I advise **hiding in-game and mini-map roads and only keep them on the map. Do the reverse for markers, hide them on map and mini-map, but let them appear in-game**.
