The Movement on the World tour map guides for Guildwars 2 on BLISH-HUD & TacO ! 

**TO GIVE FEEDBACK :** https://discord.gg/FP8dQj6KBj (thanks to Metallis for hosting me there :D)

To get some ideas of what you can do with it, check [Wiki](https://github.com/Sutcenes/MovementOnTheWorld_TacoSupport/wiki) section.

Simply use the auto-update system of Blish-HUD or TacO. Else put the "MoW.taco" into the *markers* folder of your Blish-HUD // TacO installation. Tutorial in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sutcenes/MovementOnTheWorld_TacoSupport/wiki) section (only for TacO).

You can get an overview of the work at: https://mp-repo.blishhud.com/MoW.taco.html

*All maps and markers are always subjected to change, especially because English is my second language and some of the markers display truly awful paragraphs!*
