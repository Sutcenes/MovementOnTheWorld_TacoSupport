# Movement On The World (Blish-HUD // ~~TacO~~)
The Movement on the World tour map guides for Guildwars 2 on BLISH-HUD & TacO! (Oh no, TacO is not really supported anymore by this pack D:)

**TO GIVE FEEDBACK :** https://discord.gg/FP8dQj6KBj (thanks to Metallis for hosting me there :D)

To get some ideas of what you can do with it, check [Wiki](https://github.com/Sutcenes/MovementOnTheWorld_TacoSupport/wiki) section.

Simply use the auto-update system of Blish-HUD or TacO to install.

*All maps and markers are always subjected to change, especially because English is my second language and some of the markers display truly awful paragraphs!*
